                    The firm has reported your verdict to Mr. Lee and he mentioned to you that <strong><u>the other two players, while they have the police clues, also have unique clues you donâ€™t have.</u></strong> This made Mr. Lee realize that, in order to solve the case, it might be necessary for the three players to discuss the case together.
                </p>

                <p>Mr. Lee and the three firms have arranged a meeting so that the three players can discuss the case in the next phase of the game</p>

                    The diagram below illustrates the communication structure among the three players, where a black line indicates that two players will be able to chat with each other in the discussion phase.

                        {" "}As you can see, {isAll ? "everyone will be able to chat with every other player" : "Not everyone will be able to chat with every other player"}.
                        You will be able to chat with {nbChats} other players; hence, you will see {nbChats} chat boxes during the discussion phase.
